  <h3>SENIOR DEVELOPER</h3>

Hi there! I'm Daniel Fjeldstad, and I've been passionate about web design and development since 2000. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on a variety of exciting projects, and I've learned the importance of code quality, continuous improvement, and following best coding practices as often as possible.

I believe that great code is not just about functionality, but also about readability, maintainability, and scalability. That's why I strive to write clean, well-structured code that's easy to understand and modify. I'm also a strong advocate for testing, automation, and other development practices that help ensure reliable and efficient code.

In my free time, I love to explore new technologies and techniques, experiment with design and development tools, and contribute to open-source projects.

According to [committers.top/norway_private](https://committers.top/norway_private) I am currently the most active developer in Norway on Github!

Right now my primary focus is on experimenting with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet as well as other new AI models and finding out how to best utilize it for web development, coding assistance, vector databases, embeddings, online research, implementing it with AI-based online applications, such as [spotify-import](https://github.com/w3bdesign/spotify-import) and a lot more!
